# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Capstone-Project

Requirements

Choose a subject area that interests you, identify potential problems within it you would like to address, and seek out potential datasets you could build solutions on. Address the following writing prompts with a paragraph each.

**The Problem area**:  Within it, what challenges or opportunities could your project address?

What is your area of interest?
Credit card fraud occurs when a customer uses a third party's credit card or information to make unauthorized purchases or cash advances. Credit card fraud happens both online and in physical stores. Merchants can avoid problems and bad reputations when they identify fraudulent use of credit cards in their payment environment. Credit card fraud detection is critical for companies to safeguard their customers' purchases and funds by detecting fraud before or as it occurs. The FBI reports that in 2022, more senior fraud victims in the US lost an average of $35,101 each, resulting in a total loss of more than $3 billion.

**The User**: Who experiences these problems? How would they benefit from the outcomes of your project?

**The Big Idea**: How can machine learning bring solutions to these areas? Research how other people have approached the problem previously. Refer to the "Intro to Capstone" slides on synapse for an overview of different machine learning approaches.

**The Impact**: What societal or business value do you anticipate your project to add? If possible, try to quantify the scale of the problem (in dollars, in CO2, in time spent, ...)

**The Data**: Identify several possible datasets in this subject area and describe them at a high level. Include references. If you struggle to find more than one or two datasets, this might mean a Data Science approach to the problem will be challenging. Check in with your Educator.

**The Alternative**: In a few sentences, summarise a problem in an alternative subject area that also interests you.
