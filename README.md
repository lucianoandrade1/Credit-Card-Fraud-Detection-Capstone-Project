# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Capstone-Project

Requirements

Choose a subject area that interests you, identify potential problems within it you would like to address, and seek out potential datasets you could build solutions on. Address the following writing prompts with a paragraph each.

**The Problem area**: 

What is your area of interest?

Credit card fraud occurs when a customer uses a third party's credit card or information to make unauthorized purchases or cash advances. Credit card fraud happens both online and in physical stores. Merchants can avoid problems and bad reputations when they identify fraudulent use of credit cards in their payment environment. Credit card fraud detection is critical for companies to safeguard their customers' purchases and funds by detecting fraud before or as it occurs. The FBI reports that in 2022, more senior fraud victims in the US lost an average of $35,101 each, resulting in a total loss of more than $3 billion.

Within it, what challenges or opportunities could your project address?

It's not always straightforward to agree on what fraud means. Regardless of how you define fraud, most payments are not fraudulent. Most merchants aren't experts at estimating the business impact of fraud.

Using Machine Learning for credit card fraud detection is an opportunity to create more efficient systems to avoid fraud. These systems will prevent fraud and avoid accusing legitimate purchases of fraud, too. This scenario will give the merchants more credibility, generating higher profits.

**The User**: Who experiences these problems? How would they benefit from the outcomes of your project?

Stakeholders, including issuers, banks, payment processors, and merchants, constantly seek ways to leverage multiple technological advancements to better align with their end-users preferences. In this context, they are always looking for ways to prevent fraud. As such, when a company commits fraud and incurs a significant loss, all stakeholders are directly or indirectly impacted. In some cases, employees may lose their jobs, consumers cannot access commodities, and surrounding communities may lose a significant source of tax revenue.

**The Big Idea**: How can machine learning bring solutions to these areas?

The problem of credit card fraud detection includes modeling past credit card transactions with knowledge of those that turned out to be fraud. A classification machine learning model can be used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. The goal is to maximize the detection of fraudulent transactions while minimizing fraud misclassifications.

**Research how other people have approached the problem previously. Refer to the "Intro to Capstone" slides on synapse for an overview of different machine learning approaches.**

**The Impact**: What societal or business value do you anticipate your project to add? If possible, try to quantify the scale of the problem (in dollars, in CO2, in time spent, ...)

**The Data**: Identify several possible datasets in this subject area and describe them at a high level. Include references. If you struggle to find more than one or two datasets, this might mean a Data Science approach to the problem will be challenging. Check in with your Educator.

**The Alternative**: In a few sentences, summarise a problem in an alternative subject area that also interests you.
