# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Capstone-Project

Requirements

Choose a subject area that interests you, identify potential problems within it you would like to address, and seek out potential datasets you could build solutions on. Address the following writing prompts with a paragraph each.

**The Problem area**: What is your area of interest? Within it, what challenges or opportunities could your project address?

**The User**: Who experiences these problems? How would they benefit from the outcomes of your project?

**The Big Idea**: How can machine learning bring solutions to these areas? Research how other people have approached the problem previously. Refer to the "Intro to Capstone" slides on synapse for an overview of different machine learning approaches.

**The Impact**: What societal or business value do you anticipate your project to add? If possible, try to quantify the scale of the problem (in dollars, in CO2, in time spent, ...)

**The Data**: Identify several possible datasets in this subject area and describe them at a high level. Include references. If you struggle to find more than one or two datasets, this might mean a Data Science approach to the problem will be challenging. Check in with your Educator.

**The Alternative**: In a few sentences, summarise a problem in an alternative subject area that also interests you.
